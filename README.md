My First repository (this program is bologna)

Welp, I've did it, finally!!
First repository created.

(DO NOT TRY TO USE IT, THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO USER INPUT...AND IT USES THE COMMAND LINE TO PRINT THE OUTPUT)

I'm thinking about rebuilding this (this was my first project)... I already see many improvements that can be made... like improving running time
